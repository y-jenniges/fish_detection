# Semiautomatic Detection and Classification of Marine Organisms
This is the code to the Master's Thesis project by Yvonne Jenniges.
The Master thesis **Semiautomatic Detection and Measurement of Marine Life on 
Underwater Stereoscopic Photographs Using a CNN** deals with the implementation of a 
semiautomatic solution to monitor marine organisms. For the automatic part, 
a neural network is realized to detect and classify animals. 
Using User-Centered Design methods, a user interface (MarOMarker) is developed enabling users 
to manually correct the output of the network. 
It was developed within the scope of Yvonne Jenniges' Master Thesis
[Semiautomatic Detection and Measurement of Marine Life on Underwater Stereoscopic Photographs Using a CNN (2021)](https://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agebv2/downloads/published/jenniges_thesis_21.pdf).
